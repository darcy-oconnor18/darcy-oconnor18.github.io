Hello! My name is Darcy O’Connor. I am currently a 5th grade English teacher in Williamsville, Illinois. Although I love technology, I do not have specific experience in web application or development, aside from a personal blog. I am excited to learn more about website design in this course. My goal is to one day work with our technology department at my school as a technology coach. Being able to help with web development would be a great benefit for many teachers and a great way to connect teachers within our district to grow our technology use. My favorite hobby is playing golf. I have been dealing with a back injury since my senior year of high school that has limited my play. However, last year I was hired as the girls’ golf coach at my school and given the opportunity to take my passion for the game to coaching!
