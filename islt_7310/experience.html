 <h3 id="experience1">Fifth Grade English Teacher
	Williamsville CUSD 15 – August 2018 – Present</h3>

	<p>Job Description: I currently teach fifth grade in a departmentalized team. We work together to align curriculum and each teach one subject. English and reading are split, so I focus on writing, grammar and spelling. I also work to meet social and emotional needs of a homeroom class and prepare students for state testing.</p>
	<p>Moving into a bigger school district and working with a grade-level team has provided me even more opportunities in teaching. I have been able to expand on my teamwork and aligning curriculum. I have also learned how to better document information for more students, communicate better with a larger staff and families, and dive deeper into a specific content. I am enjoying learning new methods and ways of teaching and working with a team and staff with additional resources available.</p> 

    <h3 id="experience2">Fourth Grade Teacher
	New Holland-Middletown ESD 88 – August 2014 – May 2018</h3>

	<p>Job Description: I taught in a self-contained fourth grade classroom. Being a small district, we did have small class sizes, but I was also the only fourth grade teacher with limited curriculum. I worked to plan each subject for my students, prepare them for state testing, and meet their social and emotional needs. I also served on several committees including the PERA committee, Jump Rope for Heart, and leading Field Day. </p>	

	<p>Fourth grade is where I found my passion for teaching students with technology. Being the only fourth grade teacher brought many challenges in curriculum and planning, but it also gave me freedom to explore student interest. This gave me the opportunity to explore with Maker Spaces and introducing new technology to students. I loved finding new technology to bring into the classroom and was often inspired by the students with new ways to use it. I also was able to use my creativity here to develop my own lessons and curriculum. </p>
        
    <h3 id="experience3">Preschool Teacher
	Springfield Christian Preschool – August 2012 – May 2014</h3>

	<p>Job Description: I worked with a co-teacher in a private, all day preschool classroom setting. Throughout my time there, I worked in both a 3- and 4-year-old classroom and a 4- and 5-year-old classroom. We based our curriculum off Creative Curriculum and state benchmarks, worked to keep materials aligned to ECERS, and prepared students for kindergarten by assessing with Brigance screening. </p>

	<p>There were two major takeaways from my time spent teaching preschool: flexibility and creativity. I learned the importance of flexibility in a classroom. It started with accepting the job – one that I wasn’t sure I was prepared for being such young students. I learned how to jump into that role and learn from those around me. I also learned how quickly things change in a classroom and how important it is to be flexible. My skills in working with a co-teacher also greatly improved. I also learned about the importance of creativity in the classroom. This is something that is often cut for time in an elementary classroom, but I saw the value and importance of creativity in preschool. This is something I bring with me to every classroom and work to allow students to have some of the creativity and choice in their experience in my classroom.
