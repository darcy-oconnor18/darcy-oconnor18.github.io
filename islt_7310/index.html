<p>My name is Darcy O’Connor. I am currently a 5th grade English teacher in Central Illinois. I have always been passionate about education and doing whatever I can for students, but in the past few years, I have also developed a passion for sharing technology with students. I was awarded with the Illinois Computing Educators (now Illinois Digital Educators Alliance) Teacher of the Year in 2018. I have taught for 8 years – two in preschool, four in fourth grade, and two in fifth grade. I also love to read, golf, and share those passions with students as well. I currently coach junior high track and varsity girls golf.</p>
